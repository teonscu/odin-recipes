    <h2>This is a faster, and less expensive lasagna.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can plum tomatoes with juice, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package rigatoni pasta</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggplant; cook, stirring constantly, until eggplant is softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and juice; cook until sauce is slightly reduced, about 20 minutes.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Pour sauce over pasta.</p>
